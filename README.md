# Analytical Principles

Work in this portfolio follows core biostatistical and clinical research principles:

- Statistical validity and reproducibility prioritized over model complexity
- Clinical interpretability emphasized in model selection and evaluation
- AI and machine learning used as decision-support tools, not replacements for statistical reasoning
- Analytical methods aligned with clinical trial workflows and regulatory expectations
- Transparent documentation and reproducible analysis pipelines
