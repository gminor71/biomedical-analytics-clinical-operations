- Consent obtained before any protocol-required procedures
- Documentation complete and consistent (dates, times, signatures)
- Re-consent performed when required (amendments, new risk info)

## Consent Review Checklist (During Monitoring)
- [ ] Correct ICF version in use; IRB approval dates match
- [ ] Participant (or LAR) signed/dated appropriately
- [ ] Person obtaining consent signed/dated appropriately
- [ ] All required signatures present (witness/translator if applicable)
- [ ] No study procedures performed before consent date/time
- [ ] Participant received a copy (documented per site practice)
- [ ] Re-consent completed when triggered; documented rationale if not

Missing dates, wrong version, signatures out of order, and procedures done before consent are frequent inspection issues.

- Consent language often includes genetics, tissue banking, future research, optional sub-studies
- Re-consent triggers may occur more often due to safety updates and amendments
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Considerations"}
- High enrollment volume may increase risk of consent timing or documentation errors; verify consent completion prior to any study procedures.
- Rapid recruitment environments require careful verification of consent version control and timestamp accuracy.
- Ensure subjects have adequate opportunity for questions despite accelerated enrollment workflows.
