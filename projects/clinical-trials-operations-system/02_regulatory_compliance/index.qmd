inspection-ready documentation at the site and in the TMF.

## CRA Accountability (Practical)

- Identify gaps early and drive timely resolution with documented follow-up

## Scope
Applies to all interventional trials. Therapeutic-area considerations (oncology,
infectious disease) are highlighted where relevant.
