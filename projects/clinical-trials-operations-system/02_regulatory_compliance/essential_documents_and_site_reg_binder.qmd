title: "Essential Documents & Site Regulatory Binder"
---

## Core Concept
If it isn’t documented correctly, it didn’t happen (from an inspection perspective).

## Essential Document Categories (CRA Monitoring Lens)
- Protocol + amendments
- Investigator’s Brochure (IB) / product information
- Informed consent forms (ICF) + short forms as applicable
- IRB/IEC approvals and correspondence
- Delegation of Authority (DOA) / site signature log
- Training documentation (protocol, GCP, safety, EDC)
- CVs, medical licenses (as required), and financial disclosures (if applicable)
- Normal ranges and lab certifications (central/local labs)
- IP accountability documentation (as applicable)

::: {.callout-note title="Oncology-Specific Considerations"}
- Tissue/biopsy logistics often create additional essential documentation (shipping, chain-of-custody, lab manuals)
- Imaging charter or imaging guidance may function as an essential reference for endpoints
- Higher amendment frequency → version control becomes a recurring risk area

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Considerations"}
- Time-sensitive specimen collection and processing are often critical for immunogenicity and safety endpoints.
- Laboratory manuals and specimen handling instructions must ensure consistency in timing relative to vaccination and follow-up visits.
- Cold-chain handling and accountability documentation may receive additional review during audits or inspections.
