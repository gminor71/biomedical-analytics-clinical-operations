title: "Delegation, Training & Qualification"
---

## Why Delegation Matters
Delegation links “who did the work” to “who was trained and qualified to do it.”

## Delegation of Authority (DOA) Checks
- [ ] All staff performing trial tasks are on the DOA
- [ ] Start/stop dates align with actual activity dates
- [ ] Roles/responsibilities match staff qualifications
- [ ] PI oversight documented per site practice

## Training Oversight (CRA Practical Set)
- Protocol training (initial + amendments)
- GCP training (current)
- Safety reporting training (site obligations)
- EDC/IRT training (as applicable)
- Lab/manual training (specimen handling; imaging manuals if applicable)

- Specialized administration procedures and toxicity management workflows may require documented training
- Imaging review processes often require documented training or guidance acknowledgments

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Considerations"}
- Training related to vaccination procedures, specimen collection timing, and protocol-defined visit windows is often critical to endpoint validity.
- Training documentation serves as an important risk control to ensure consistency across high-volume enrollment and follow-up activities.
- Ensure delegation logs accurately reflect staff performing vaccination, safety assessments, and specimen collection activities.
