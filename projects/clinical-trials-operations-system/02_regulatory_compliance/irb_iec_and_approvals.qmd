title: "IRB/IEC & Approvals"

## Approval Rules of Thumb (CRA Use)
- No site activity begins before IRB/IEC approval (per protocol and site requirements)
- All versions of protocol/ICF in use must be IRB/IEC-approved
- Continuing review approvals must remain current (if applicable)

## Approval Verification Workflow

## CRA Monitoring Checks

- [ ] Current IRB approval covers current protocol version
- [ ] ICF version in use matches IRB approval letter
- [ ] Recruitment materials approved (if used)
- [ ] Continuing review dates tracked; no lapse occurred
- [ ] Local IRB requirements met (if multi-IRB environment)

Safety updates and amendments are frequent → approval tracking must be disciplined

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Considerations"}
Vaccine trials may operate under accelerated start-up timelines to support rapid enrollment.
Ensure IRB/IEC approvals, consent versions, recruitment materials, and protocol amendments
are fully documented and filed despite compressed activation schedules.
