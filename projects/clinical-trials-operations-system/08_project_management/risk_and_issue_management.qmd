title: "Risk & Issue Management"
---

## Purpose
Risk and issue management is the primary mechanism by which
project management maintains **control over trial execution**.

The goal is not to eliminate problems, but to:
- anticipate them,
- detect them early,
- mitigate their impact,
- and escalate appropriately.

## Risk vs Issue vs Deviation

These terms are often confused but represent different concepts:

| Concept | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| Risk | A potential future problem |
| Issue | A current active problem |
| Deviation | A compliance failure |

Examples:

- Risk: Sites may fail to enroll on time  
- Issue: Site A missed enrollment target  
- Deviation: Site A violated protocol inclusion criteria  

Each requires a different response.

## The Risk Register

A risk register is a structured list of:

- identified risks
- probability of occurrence
- potential impact
- mitigation strategies
- current status

Typical risk categories:

- Operational (enrollment, monitoring)
- Regulatory (IRB delays)
- Safety (late SAE reporting)
- Data quality (high query rates)
- Vendor performance

---

## Risk Assessment Dimensions

Risks are assessed using two primary dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|----------|----------|
| Probability | How likely is this to occur? |
| Impact | How severe would the effect be? |

High-probability, high-impact risks receive **highest priority**.

---

## Issues and Escalation

An issue represents a risk that has **materialized**.

Issues require:
- immediate attention,
- root cause analysis,
- and often escalation.

Common escalation triggers:
- missed critical milestones
- repeated protocol deviations
- systemic safety reporting failures
- data integrity concerns

---

## Escalation Pathways

Escalation typically flows:

CRA → CTM → CPM / Trial Lead → Sponsor → Steering Committee

Escalation is not failure.
It is a **control mechanism**.

---

## Relationship to CAPA

Issues that represent:
- systemic failures,
- repeated deviations,
- or quality breakdowns

often require **Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)**.

Risk management identifies problems.  
CAPA resolves root causes.

---

## Risk Management as a Living Process

Risk management is not a one-time activity.

It evolves throughout the trial:
- new risks emerge,
- priorities shift,
- mitigations change.

The risk register should be reviewed:
- at every study team meeting,
- before major milestones,
- and during inspection preparation.

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Consideration"}
Vaccine trials frequently require accelerated decision-making cycles
due to enrollment speed and public health timelines.
Governance structures must support rapid escalation and response.
