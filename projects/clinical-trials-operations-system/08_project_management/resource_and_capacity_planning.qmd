title: "Resource & Capacity Planning"
---

## Purpose
Resource planning ensures that the trial has **sufficient human capacity**
to execute planned activities.

In clinical trials, resources are primarily:
- CRAs
- CTMs
- data managers
- safety staff
- vendors

---

## CRA Capacity

CRA workload is driven by:
- number of sites
- visit frequency
- complexity
- risk level

Overloaded CRAs lead to:
- missed visits
- delayed follow-up
- quality issues
- burnout

---

## Site Load

Sites differ in:
- enrollment volume
- data quality
- deviation rate
- support needs

High-burden sites require:
- increased monitoring
- more communication
- escalation readiness

---

## Vendor Oversight

External vendors include:
- CROs
- labs
- imaging vendors
- EDC providers

PM must monitor:
- performance metrics
- deliverable timelines
- contract obligations

Vendors are resources, not black boxes.

---

## Scaling and Reallocation

Resource plans must adapt to:
- new sites
- delayed enrollment
- emerging risks
- staff turnover

PM’s role is to:
- anticipate overload,
- redistribute work,
- and prevent systemic failure.

## Resource Planning as Risk Management

In practice, most trial failures result from:
> insufficient or misaligned resources.

Resource planning is therefore a **primary risk control activity**.
