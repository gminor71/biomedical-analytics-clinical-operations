title: "Delivery Metrics & KPIs"
---

## Purpose
Metrics and KPIs provide **quantitative visibility**
into trial performance.

They allow project management to:
- detect problems early,
- track trends,
- and justify decisions.

Without metrics, PM is blind.

## Key Performance Domains

Typical KPI categories:

| Domain | Examples |
|-------|---------|
| Start-Up | % sites activated |
| Monitoring | Visit completion rate |
| Safety | SAE reporting timeliness |
| Data Quality | Query aging |
| Quality | Deviation rate |
| Delivery | Milestone adherence |

---

## Examples of Operational KPIs

### Monitoring
- % scheduled visits completed
- average days to report findings

### Data Quality
- open queries per subject
- median query resolution time

### Safety
- % SAEs reported within 24 hours
- unresolved safety follow-ups

### Quality
- deviations per site
- CAPA closure time

## Leading vs Lagging Indicators

| Type | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Leading | Predict future problems |
| Lagging | Confirm past performance |

Examples:
- High query aging → leading indicator  
- Missed DBL → lagging indicator  

Effective PM prioritizes **leading indicators**.

## KPIs as Decision Inputs

Metrics are not for reporting.
They are for **decision-making**.

KPIs inform:
- resource reallocation
- escalation
- vendor performance
- risk prioritization

KPIs are a **control system**, not a scoreboard.
