title: "Governance & Communication"
---

## Purpose
Governance defines **how decisions are made** in a clinical trial.

While CRA operations generate information,
governance structures determine:
- who reviews it,
- who decides,
- and how actions are authorized.

Effective governance prevents:
- unclear accountability,
- delayed decisions,
- and unmanaged escalation.

---

## Governance Structures

Typical governance layers include:

| Level | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| Study Team | Operational coordination |
| Safety Review Committee | Safety oversight |
| Vendor Governance | CRO / vendor performance |
| Steering Committee | Strategic decisions |

Not all trials require all layers,
but every trial requires **defined decision pathways**.

---

## Study Team Meetings

Study team meetings typically occur:
- weekly or biweekly during conduct

Common agenda:
- enrollment status
- monitoring progress
- safety updates
- data quality issues
- risk register review

These meetings are the **operational heartbeat** of the trial.

## RACI Framework

RACI defines roles:

| Role | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| R | Responsible (does the work) |
| A | Accountable (owns outcome) |
| C | Consulted |
| I | Informed |

Example:
- CRA: Responsible for monitoring
- CTM: Accountable for monitoring quality
- Safety: Consulted on AE issues
- Sponsor: Informed of status

---

## Decision Logs

All major trial decisions should be documented:

- protocol amendments
- enrollment strategy changes
- vendor replacements
- escalation outcomes

Decision logs provide:
- transparency
- accountability
- audit trail

---

## Communication as Risk Control

Poor communication is itself a risk.

Governance ensures:
- consistent information flow,
- documented decisions,
- controlled escalation,
- and stakeholder alignment.

Communication is not soft skill.
It is a **control mechanism**.
