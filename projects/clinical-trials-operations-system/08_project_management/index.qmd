title: "Project Management in Clinical Trials"
---

## Purpose of Project Management
Project management in clinical trials functions as the **control layer**
over operational execution.

While CRA operations focus on *what happens at sites*, project management
focuses on:

- how work is planned,
- how progress is monitored,
- how risks are managed,
- and how decisions are made.

Project management does not replace clinical operations.  
It coordinates and steers them.

## Execution Layer vs Control Layer

| Layer | Function |
|------|---------|
| Execution (CRA Ops) | Conduct visits, verify data, manage safety |
| Quality & Safety | CAPA, TMF, pharmacovigilance |
| Control (PM) | Planning, prioritization, escalation, decision-making |

The PM layer exists to ensure that:
- timelines are realistic,
- resources are aligned,
- risks are anticipated,
- and the trial remains on track.

## PM Across the Trial Lifecycle

Project management spans the entire lifecycle:

- Start-Up: site selection, activation planning  
- Conduct: monitoring cadence, enrollment tracking  
- Quality: deviation trends, CAPA oversight  
- Close-Out: database lock, CSR delivery  
- Inspection: readiness, response coordination  

PM is continuous, not a single phase.

## Information Flow

Clinical trials generate signals:

- missed visits
- delayed data
- protocol deviations
- safety events

These signals flow upward into the PM layer, where they become:

- risks
- issues
- escalations
- decisions

PM converts operational signals into **governance actions**.

## Relationship to Other Modules

Project management interfaces with:

- Monitoring Operations → delivery tracking  
- Safety & Pharmacovigilance → escalation thresholds  
- Data Quality & Analytics → performance metrics  
- Deviations & CAPA → systemic risk  
- Inspection Readiness → response coordination  

PM is the **integrating layer** of the entire binder.
