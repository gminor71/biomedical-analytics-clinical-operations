title: "Trial Planning & Milestones"
---

## What is Being Planned?
In clinical trials, the “project” is the **delivery of evidence**.

The primary planning objectives are:

- activate sites,
- enroll subjects,
- generate clean data,
- analyze outcomes,
- deliver regulatory-grade results.

## Major Trial Milestones

Typical high-level milestones:

| Milestone | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| FSI | First Site Initiated |
| FPI | First Patient In |
| LPI | Last Patient In |
| LPLV | Last Patient Last Visit |
| DBL | Database Lock |
| CSR | Clinical Study Report |

These milestones define the **critical path** of the trial.

## Critical Path Concept

The critical path represents:
> the sequence of activities that determines the earliest possible
> completion date of the trial.

Common critical path blockers:
- slow site activation
- poor enrollment
- delayed monitoring
- unresolved data queries
- late safety reporting

---

## Dependencies

Many tasks depend on others:

| Task | Depends On |
|------|-----------|
| Monitoring | Site activation |
| Enrollment | IRB approval |
| Database lock | Query resolution |
| CSR | Final analyses |

PM’s role is to identify and manage these dependencies.

## What Does “On Track” Mean?

A trial is considered “on track” when:

- milestones are met on time,
- risks are controlled,
- data quality is acceptable,
- safety reporting is timely,
- and no unresolved critical issues exist.

“On track” is not just schedule — it is **system health**.
