title: "Inspection Readiness Framework"
---

## The Core Principle
Inspection readiness is not an event.
It is a **continuous operational state.**

## Readiness Domains
- Regulatory documentation
- Monitoring records
- Safety reporting
- Deviation/CAPA management
- Data quality controls
- Training and delegation

## CRA Reality
You prepare for inspections by how you work **every day**.
