## RBM Concept
Focus monitoring on:
- Critical data
- High-risk sites
- Emerging trends

## RBM Inputs (CRA Level)
- Deviation frequency
- Query patterns
- Late data
- Safety reporting delays
- Staff turnover

## Example RBM Risk Scoring

| Site | Deviations | Late Data | Query Rate | Risk Level |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| A | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| B | High | High | Medium | High |
| C | Medium | Low | High | Medium |

## CRA Role
- Interpret risk scores
- Adjust monitoring focus
- Escalate high-risk sites

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Consideration"}
Enrollment rate and visit compliance metrics are often leading indicators
of overall trial success in vaccine studies due to narrow endpoint windows.
