title: "Key CRA Metrics"

## Core Operational Metrics

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Query rate | Data quality burden |
| SDV completion % | Monitoring compliance |
| Enrollment rate | Site performance |
| Screen failure rate | Eligibility issues |
| Protocol deviations | Process failures |
| SAE rate | Safety signal volume |
| Data entry lag | Timeliness risk |

## CRA Insight
Metrics are not performance scores.
They are **risk indicators.**

## How to Use These Metrics (Signal → Action)

These metrics should trigger structured follow-up, not isolated reactions.
Use them to determine whether a concern is:

- **site-specific** (one site deviating), or
- **systemic** (trend across sites or over time).

When a metric shifts, interpret it as:

**Operational Signal → Risk Interpretation → Next Action**

## Metric Interpretation and Typical Actions

| Metric | Operational Signal | Potential Risk | Typical Next Action / Escalation |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Query rate | Increased data clarification burden | Data quality risk; monitoring burden | Review query drivers; coordinate with DM; focus monitoring on recurring fields |
| SDV completion % | Visit backlog or incomplete verification | Oversight and inspection risk | Reprioritize SDV to critical data; escalate resourcing constraints to CTM/PM |
| Enrollment rate | Enrollment below forecast | Timeline risk | Confirm screening workflow; escalate persistent underperformance; consider mitigation plan (additional sites, recruitment support) |
| Screen failure rate | Eligibility mismatch or pre-screening gaps | Inefficient enrollment; feasibility risk | Review criteria interpretation; retrain on eligibility; improve pre-screening workflow |
| Protocol deviations | Process inconsistency | Quality risk; endpoint validity risk | Trend deviations; determine root cause; escalate systemic patterns for CAPA consideration |
| SAE rate | Increased safety event volume | Potential safety signal | Verify documentation/reporting timeliness; coordinate with safety for trend review |
| Data entry lag | Delayed data availability | Downstream delays (queries, DBL) | Reinforce entry expectations; prioritize time-critical forms; escalate persistent lag |

## Leading vs Lagging Indicators

| Type | Meaning | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| Leading indicator | Predicts future issues | Increasing query aging, growing data entry lag, declining SDV completion |
| Lagging indicator | Confirms issues already occurred | Missed visits, missed milestones, inspection findings |

Prioritize **leading indicators** to prevent downstream failures.

## Governance Link

Metrics become most useful when they feed into:

- the **risk register** (risk & issue management),
- **monitoring strategy adjustments** (RBM emphasis),
- and **governance decisions** (resource allocation, escalation, CAPA initiation).

Use metrics to support clear communication:
- what changed,
- why it matters,
- what action is recommended,
- and what support is needed.
