title: "Data Quality & Analytics"
---

## Purpose
This module defines how CRAs use data to monitor site performance,
identify risks, and support evidence-based oversight.
Within the Trial Lifecycle Map, analytics supports continuous
risk assessment during the Conduct phase.

## CRA Accountability (Practical)
- Track key operational metrics
- Identify data quality risks early
- Support risk-based monitoring (RBM)
- Detect trends and systemic issues
- Escalate based on evidence, not intuition

## Why This Matters
Modern trials are data-driven.
CRAs who understand analytics become **decision-support partners**, not just monitors.
