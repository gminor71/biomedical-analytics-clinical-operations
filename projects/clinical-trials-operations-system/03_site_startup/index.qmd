title: "Site Start-Up & Activation"
---

## Purpose
This module defines the CRA’s role in site feasibility, initiation,
and activation to ensure sites are prepared to conduct the trial
in compliance with protocol and regulatory requirements.
As shown in the Trial Lifecycle Map, Start-Up represents the transition
from site identification to activation and enrollment.

## CRA Accountability (Practical)
- Assess site suitability and readiness
- Support Site Initiation Visit (SIV) execution
- Verify training, documentation, and system access
- Confirm activation criteria are met before enrollment

## Scope
Applies to all interventional clinical trials. Therapeutic-area
considerations (oncology, infectious disease) are highlighted where relevant.
