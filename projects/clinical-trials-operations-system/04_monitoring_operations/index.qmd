title: "Monitoring Operations"
---

## Purpose
This module defines the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) responsibilities
for monitoring clinical trial sites to ensure subject safety, data integrity,
and regulatory compliance.

## Scope
Applies to on-site and remote monitoring across all interventional clinical trials.
Therapeutic-area–specific considerations (e.g., oncology, vaccine trials)
are highlighted where applicable.

::: {.callout-note title="Therapeutic Area Considerations"}
The monitoring framework described in this module represents the
core execution model for clinical trials.

Therapeutic area appendices (e.g., oncology or vaccine trials)
do not change monitoring principles or responsibilities.
Instead, they modify the **areas of emphasis** within monitoring
activities based on differences in safety profiles, endpoint timing,
and operational risk.

CRAs should apply the same monitoring framework while adjusting
focus according to study-specific risks and therapeutic context.
