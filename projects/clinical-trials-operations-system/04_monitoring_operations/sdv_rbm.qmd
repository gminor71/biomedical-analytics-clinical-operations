title: "Source Data Verification & Risk-Based Monitoring"
---

## Source Data Verification (SDV)

### Definition
Comparison of data recorded in the EDC against source documents
to ensure accuracy, completeness, and reliability.

### Typical SDV Areas
- Informed consent dates
- Eligibility criteria
- Primary endpoint data
- Safety data (AEs / SAEs)
- IP dosing records

---

## Risk-Based Monitoring (RBM)

### Principles
- Focus on critical data and processes
- Reduce unnecessary SDV
- Identify systemic risks early

### CRA Responsibilities
- Apply monitoring plan consistently
- Escalate emerging risk trends
- Document rationale for targeted SDV

::: {.callout-note title="Oncology-Specific Considerations"}
- Cycle 1 often requires 100% SDV
- Dose modifications and delays require close source review
- Tumor assessments (e.g., RECIST) must be traceable to source

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Consideration"}
Monitoring in vaccine trials may emphasize visit timing adherence,
consent accuracy, and rapid data entry due to time-sensitive endpoints.
