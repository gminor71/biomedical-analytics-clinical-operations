## Purpose
This module defines the CRA’s role in safety oversight and pharmacovigilance
during clinical trial conduct.

## CRA Accountability (Practical)
- Confirm site awareness of safety reporting obligations
- Verify documentation of AEs/SAEs is complete and timely
- Ensure follow-up information is obtained and documented
- Identify safety trends or systemic issues and escalate appropriately

## Scope
Applies to all interventional trials. Therapeutic-area–specific considerations
(oncology, infectious disease) are highlighted where relevant.
