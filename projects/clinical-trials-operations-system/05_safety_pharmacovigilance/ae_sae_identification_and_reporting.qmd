title: "AE & SAE Identification and Reporting"
---

## Definitions (Operational)
- **Adverse Event (AE):** Any unfavorable medical occurrence
- **Serious Adverse Event (SAE):** Results in death, life-threatening condition,
  hospitalization, disability, or is medically significant

## CRA Oversight Objectives
- Site recognizes and reports events per protocol
- Reporting timelines are met
- Documentation is complete and traceable

## CRA Monitoring Checks
- [ ] All AEs documented in source and EDC
- [ ] SAEs reported to sponsor within required timelines
- [ ] SAE forms complete (onset date, outcome, seriousness criteria)
- [ ] Supporting source documentation present
- [ ] Follow-up information obtained when required

::: {.callout-note title="Oncology-Specific Considerations"}
- High volume of expected toxicities → risk of under-reporting
- Hospitalizations may be protocol-expected but still require documentation
- Immune-related AEs (irAEs) often require prolonged follow-up

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Consideration"}
Because vaccine trials frequently involve healthy populations,
unexpected safety signals may require rapid escalation and governance review,
even when event severity is low.
