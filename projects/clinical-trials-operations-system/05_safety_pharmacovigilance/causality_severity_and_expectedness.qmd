title: "Causality, Severity & Expectedness"
---

## Key Concepts (CRA Lens)

### Causality
Relationship between study intervention and event.

### Severity
Intensity of the event (e.g., mild, moderate, severe).

### Expectedness
Whether the event is described in protocol/IB/product label.

## CRA Role
CRAs:
- Do not determine medical causality
- Verify that causality/severity fields are completed
- Ensure consistency between source, SAE forms, and EDC

## Common CRA Findings
- Missing severity grading
- Inconsistent causality across documents
- Expected events not documented because “they were expected”
