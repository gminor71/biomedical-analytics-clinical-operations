title: "Safety Framework & Roles"
---

## What “Safety Oversight” Means for a CRA
CRAs do not perform medical assessment, but they:
- Verify safety processes are followed
- Confirm documentation supports reported events
- Escalate incomplete, late, or inconsistent reporting

## Roles (Simplified)

| Role | Primary Responsibility |
|------|------------------------|
| Investigator | Medical assessment and reporting of AEs/SAEs |
| Sponsor/CRO Safety | Regulatory reporting and aggregate analysis |
| CRA | Oversight, verification, and follow-up documentation |

## Inspection Reality
Inspectors will not ask CRAs to judge medical causality,
but **will ask whether safety processes were followed and documented.**
