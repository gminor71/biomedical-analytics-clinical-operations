title: "Case Study: Inspection Finding – Data Quality & Source Documentation"
---

## Scenario

During a regulatory inspection, the auditor identified inconsistencies
between source documentation and data entered in the Electronic Data
Capture (EDC) system at multiple sites.

Examples included:

- incomplete source documentation supporting entered data,
- discrepancies between visit dates in source and EDC,
- delayed data entry following subject visits.

Although no evidence of intentional misconduct was identified,
the findings raised concerns regarding data reliability and
monitoring effectiveness.

---

## Operational Signals

Prior to inspection, several indicators suggested elevated data quality risk:

- increased query rates at multiple sites,
- repeated data clarification requests,
- delayed query resolution,
- monitoring findings related to documentation completeness,
- variability in source documentation practices between sites.

These signals were visible through:

- monitoring reports,
- data management metrics,
- and query aging analytics.

---

## Risk Assessment

Inspection findings related to data quality represent high-impact risk because they affect:

- credibility of study data,
- regulatory acceptance of results,
- sponsor reputation,
- and inspection outcomes.

Potential consequences include:

- inspection observations,
- requirement for corrective actions,
- or increased regulatory scrutiny.

Risk classification:

| Dimension | Assessment |
|------------|-----------|
| Probability | Moderate |
| Impact | High |
| Priority | High |

## System Response

The Clinical Trial Operations System responds through coordinated
execution, governance, and quality actions.

### Execution Layer (Monitoring Operations)

Immediate actions included:

- verification of affected data points,
- confirmation of source documentation completeness,
- clarification of documentation expectations with site staff,
- targeted review of similar data across subjects and visits.

Monitoring focus shifted toward:

- source documentation consistency,
- timeliness of data entry,
- and documentation practices.

---

### Analytics Layer

Data trends were reviewed to determine scope:

- identification of sites with elevated query rates,
- assessment of recurring data discrepancies,
- comparison of affected variables across sites.

Analytics helped determine whether the issue was:
- isolated,
- site-specific,
- or systemic.

---

### Governance Layer (Project Management)

The inspection finding was logged as a critical issue.

Governance actions included:

- cross-functional review with monitoring, data management, and quality,
- prioritization of remediation activities,
- reassessment of monitoring strategy,
- communication with sponsor leadership.

Decision-making focused on:
- risk containment,
- documentation remediation timelines,
- and prevention of recurrence.

---

### Quality & CAPA Response

Because findings affected multiple sites, the issue was treated as systemic.

CAPA activities included:

- root cause analysis of documentation practices,
- additional training on source documentation expectations,
- updated monitoring focus areas,
- enhanced oversight until corrective actions proved effective.

CAPA effectiveness checks ensured that improvements were sustained.

---

## Outcome

Successful resolution resulted in:

- correction of affected data discrepancies,
- improved documentation consistency,
- strengthened monitoring focus,
- and improved inspection readiness.

The event reinforced the importance of early signal detection
through monitoring and analytics.
