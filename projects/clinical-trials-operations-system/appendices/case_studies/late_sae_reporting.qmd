title: "Case Study: Late SAE Reporting"
---

## Scenario

During routine monitoring review, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
was identified in source documentation that had not been reported
to the sponsor within the protocol-defined reporting timeline.

The event was eventually reported, but outside the required
reporting window.

Subsequent review identified delayed follow-up documentation
and uncertainty at the site regarding reporting responsibilities.

This raised concerns regarding both patient safety oversight
and regulatory compliance.

---

## Operational Signals

Several indicators suggested an emerging safety oversight issue:

- SAE identified during monitoring rather than proactive reporting
- Delay between event occurrence and sponsor notification
- Incomplete or delayed follow-up information
- Site uncertainty regarding reporting timelines
- Similar reporting delays observed at prior visits

These signals were identified through:

- source data verification,
- monitoring visit findings,
- and safety reconciliation activities.

---

## Risk Assessment

Late SAE reporting represents a high-risk event because it impacts:

- patient safety oversight,
- sponsor pharmacovigilance responsibilities,
- regulatory compliance,
- and inspection readiness.

Potential consequences include:

- delayed safety signal evaluation,
- regulatory findings,
- or increased inspection scrutiny.

Risk classification:

| Dimension | Assessment |
|------------|-----------|
| Probability | Moderate |
| Impact | High |
| Priority | High |

## System Response

The Clinical Trial Operations System addresses safety issues
through coordinated execution, governance, and quality actions.

### Execution Layer (Site Operations)

Immediate actions included:

- verification of event details and timelines,
- confirmation that the SAE was fully documented,
- clarification of reporting responsibilities with site staff,
- reinforcement of reporting procedures.

Monitoring follow-up ensured:
- complete safety documentation,
- appropriate investigator awareness,
- and prevention of recurrence.

---

### Safety Oversight Layer

Safety personnel reviewed:

- seriousness and expectedness classification,
- completeness of safety narrative,
- follow-up requirements,
- and potential impact on ongoing safety evaluation.

Reconciliation between EDC and safety systems ensured
no additional unreported events existed.

---

### Governance Layer (Project Management)

The event was logged as an issue and reviewed for escalation.

Governance actions included:

- review during study team meetings,
- assessment of whether issue was isolated or systemic,
- evaluation of additional site training needs,
- increased oversight for affected site.

Escalation decisions were based on:
- recurrence risk,
- site performance history,
- and potential regulatory exposure.

---

### Quality & CAPA Considerations

If delayed reporting reflected systemic process failure,
Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) was initiated.

Possible CAPA actions included:

- targeted retraining,
- clarification of reporting workflows,
- enhanced monitoring frequency,
- documentation of process improvements.

CAPA ensured that corrective actions addressed root cause,
not only the individual event.

---

## Outcome

Successful resolution resulted in:

- restored compliance with reporting timelines,
- improved site understanding of safety responsibilities,
- and strengthened safety oversight processes.

Early identification prevented escalation into a systemic
safety compliance issue.
