title: "Case Study: Enrollment Underperformance"
---

## Scenario

A multi-site clinical trial completed site activation according to plan.
Enrollment was expected to reach steady-state within three months of
First Patient In (FPI).

After four months, enrollment remained significantly below forecast.
Several activated sites had screened few or no subjects.

The projected Last Patient In (LPI) milestone was at risk.

---

## Operational Signals

Multiple indicators suggested emerging enrollment risk:

- Low screening activity at several sites
- High screen failure rates at enrolling sites
- Increasing time between subject enrollments
- Site inactivity despite activation
- Enrollment projections diverging from actual performance

These signals were identified through:

- site performance tracking,
- monitoring visit observations,
- and enrollment analytics.

---

## Risk Assessment

Enrollment underperformance represents a high-impact operational risk
because it affects:

- trial timelines,
- study costs,
- resource allocation,
- and regulatory deliverables.

If unresolved, delayed enrollment may lead to:
- extension of study duration,
- delayed database lock,
- or reduced statistical power.

In vaccine trials, enrollment underperformance may have amplified
impact due to narrow seasonal or epidemiologic enrollment windows.

Risk classification:

| Dimension | Assessment |
|------------|-----------|
| Probability | High |
| Impact | High |
| Priority | Critical |

## System Response

The Clinical Trial Operations System addresses enrollment issues
across execution, governance, and quality layers.

### Execution Layer (Site Operations)

Actions at the site level included:

- Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria interpretation
- Assessment of recruitment processes
- Verification of site engagement and staffing
- Identification of operational barriers to screening

Monitoring visits focused on identifying:
- workflow inefficiencies,
- misunderstandings of eligibility criteria,
- and local recruitment challenges.

---

### Analytics Layer

Enrollment metrics were reviewed to determine:

- site-level variability,
- screen failure drivers,
- enrollment trends over time,
- comparison against forecast assumptions.

Leading indicators included:
- screening-to-enrollment ratio,
- time between enrollments,
- inactive site duration.

---

### Governance Layer (Project Management)

Enrollment underperformance was entered into the risk register
as a high-priority operational risk.

Governance actions included:

- escalation during study team meetings,
- enrollment mitigation planning,
- reassessment of enrollment forecasts,
- evaluation of additional site activation.

Potential decisions included:
- opening backup sites,
- reallocating monitoring resources,
- modifying recruitment strategies where permitted.

---

### Quality & CAPA Considerations

If enrollment challenges were linked to systemic issues
(e.g., protocol complexity or eligibility interpretation),
corrective actions were considered:

- additional investigator training,
- clarification documents,
- or protocol amendment discussion.

---

## Outcome

Successful mitigation results in:

- stabilization of enrollment rates,
- alignment of projections with actual performance,
- and reduced timeline risk.

Even when timelines require adjustment,
early detection allows controlled decision-making
rather than reactive crisis management.
