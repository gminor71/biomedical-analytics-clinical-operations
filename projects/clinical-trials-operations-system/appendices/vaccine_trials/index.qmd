## Purpose

This appendix describes operational considerations specific to
vaccine clinical trials within the Clinical Trial Operations System.

The core system remains unchanged.
This appendix highlights where execution, governance, safety,
and analytics priorities differ due to:

- large enrollment scale,
- healthy volunteer populations,
- time-sensitive endpoints,
- and heightened safety sensitivity.
