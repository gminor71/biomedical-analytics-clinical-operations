title: "Vaccine Trials Quick Reference"
---

Vaccine trials frequently require rapid enrollment of large
subject populations. Site feasibility therefore emphasizes
recruitment capacity, scheduling efficiency, and access to
eligible populations rather than therapeutic specialization.

::: {.callout-note title="CRA Considerations"}
During vaccine trials, CRAs should closely observe site workflow efficiency,
screening throughput, and scheduling processes during early visits.
Operational bottlenecks may emerge rapidly due to high enrollment volume
and should be escalated early to project management.
