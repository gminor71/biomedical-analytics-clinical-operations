title: "Dose-Limiting Toxicity & Escalation"
---

## What is a DLT?
A toxicity that limits further dose escalation.

## CRA Implications
- Critical documentation of timing and severity
- Close monitoring of Cycle 1
- Safety review committees (SRC/DSMB)

## Escalation Designs
- 3+3
- Bayesian adaptive models
- Modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI)
