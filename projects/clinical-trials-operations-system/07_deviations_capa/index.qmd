title: "Protocol Deviations & CAPA"
---


## Purpose
This module defines how protocol deviations are identified, documented,
classified, and corrected through CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions).

## CRA Accountability (Practical)
- Identify deviations during monitoring
- Ensure deviations are documented and reported appropriately
- Assess risk and impact with the study team
- Track CAPAs to resolution
- Detect trends and systemic issues

## Why This Matters
Deviations and CAPAs are one of the **highest inspection risk areas**
in clinical trials.
