title: "Deviation Identification & Documentation"
---

## How Deviations Are Identified
- Monitoring visits
- Data review / listings
- Safety review
- Sponsor or CRO queries
- Site self-reporting

## CRA Responsibilities
- Confirm deviation occurred (source verification)
- Ensure site documents deviation
- Verify required reporting pathways followed
- Track deviation to resolution

## Documentation Principles
- Factual and objective
- Traceable to source
- Includes date, description, impact, action

::: {.callout-note title="Oncology-Specific Considerations"}
- Dose modifications and delays often generate deviations
- Imaging windows frequently missed due to scheduling complexity
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Vaccine Trial Considerations"}
- Missed or out-of-window visits may compromise immunogenicity or safety endpoint validity.
- Vaccination timing and protocol-defined follow-up intervals are often critical to endpoint interpretation.
- Deviations related to dosing schedule or specimen collection timing may require heightened review.
