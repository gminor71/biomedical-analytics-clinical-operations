## Why Trending Matters
Single deviations may be minor.
Patterns indicate **systemic risk.**

## Examples of Trends

- Frequent missed visits
- Ongoing safety reporting delays
- Consistent data entry issues

## CRA Role in Trending
- Maintain deviation log
- Identify recurring patterns
- Escalate systemic risks
- Support sponsor QA reviews

## Inspection Reality
Inspectors focus heavily on:
- Repeat deviations
- Weak CAPA effectiveness
- Lack of trend analysis
