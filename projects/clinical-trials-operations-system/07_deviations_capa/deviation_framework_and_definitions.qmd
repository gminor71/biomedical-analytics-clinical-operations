## What is a Protocol Deviation?
Any instance where study conduct differs from the approved protocol,
GCP, or regulatory requirements.

## Common Deviation Categories
- Informed consent errors
- Eligibility violations
- Missed or out-of-window visits
- Incorrect dosing or IP handling
- Missing assessments
- Safety reporting delays

## CRA Reality Check
Not all deviations are catastrophic,
but **all must be documented, assessed, and addressed.**
