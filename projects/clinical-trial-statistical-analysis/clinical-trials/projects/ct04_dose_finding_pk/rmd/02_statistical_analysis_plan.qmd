## Objectives
Characterize pharmacokinetic exposure across dose levels and evaluate dose/exposure relationships with clinical response and safety in an early-phase dose-finding trial.

## Estimand Definition

**Population:**
All randomized subjects with at least one post-dose PK sample (PK analysis population). Analyses of clinical response and safety will be conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population unless otherwise specified.

## Primary Endpoint (Pharmacokinetic Exposure)
Pharmacokinetic exposure summarized using derived parameters:
- Area Under the Concentration–Time Curve (AUC)
- Maximum observed concentration (Cmax)

PK parameters will be derived from concentration–time data using standardized procedures defined in the analysis scripts. Exposure summaries will be evaluated by dose group.

## Key Secondary Endpoint 1 (Dose Proportionality)
- Relationship between administered dose and pharmacokinetic exposure.
- Dose proportionality will be assessed using log-transformed exposure metrics (AUC and/or Cmax) evaluated against log-transformed dose levels.

## Key Secondary Endpoint 2 (Exposure–Response)
Clinical response evaluated as a function of pharmacokinetic exposure.
The response endpoint is defined as:
- Responder status, defined as achievement of a prespecified clinical improvement threshold at the primary assessment timepoint.

Exposure–response analyses will evaluate the association between exposure (AUC or Cmax) and probability of response.

## Key Secondary Endpoint 3 (Safety)
Safety endpoints include:

- ccurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the observation period
- Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)

Safety outcomes will be summarized descriptively by dose group.

**Intercurrent Events:**
- Missing PK samples due to missed draws, withdrawal, or assay failure
- Dose interruptions/reductions or non-adherence affecting exposure
- Early discontinuation prior to planned response assessment

**Strategy for Intercurrent Events:**
Treatment policy strategy: analyses will use all available observed data collected post-dose. Dose modifications and discontinuations will not lead to censoring of available PK samples or outcome measurements; they will be reflected in the observed exposure and outcomes.

**Summary Measures (Estimands):**
- Primary estimand: Difference in mean exposure (AUC and/or Cmax) across dose levels.
- Dose proportionality estimand: Slope from log(exposure) on log(dose), where a slope near 1 indicates proportional exposure increase with dose.
- Exposure–response estimand: Change in probability of response associated with increasing exposure.
- Safety estimand: Differences in DLT or TEAE incidence across dose levels.

## Intercurrent Events and Missing Data

### Intercurrent Events
Intercurrent events include missed PK draws, withdrawal prior to PK completion, dose interruptions/reductions, and early discontinuation.

### Strategy for Intercurrent Events
A treatment policy strategy will be used: all observed post-dose PK concentrations and clinical outcomes will be included in the relevant analyses.

### Missing Data Assumptions
PK parameters are assumed Missing At Random (MAR), conditional on observed dose, visit/time, and available concentration history.
Clinical response missingness is assumed MAR conditional on baseline covariates and observed follow-up data.

### Primary Handling Method
- PK parameter derivation will use available concentration–time data. Subjects with insufficient PK samples to derive a parameter may be excluded from that specific PK parameter summary, with counts reported.
- Regression-based analyses will use complete-case data for the variables required in each model, with missingness summarized by dose group.
- (Sensitivity analyses evaluating robustness to missingness mechanisms and influential observations are described below.)

### Analysis Populations
- PK analysis population: Subjects with at least one post-dose PK measurement; derivation of AUC/Cmax requires sufficient sampling for calculation.
- ITT population: All randomized subjects for clinical response and safety summaries.

### Primary Statistical Methods
PK Exposure Summaries by Dose
PK parameters (AUC and/or Cmax) will be summarized by dose level using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, IQR, min, max). Exposure will be visualized across dose groups using boxplots and concentration–time profiles (as applicable).
A regression-based comparison of exposure by dose group will be performed:
Model: exposure ~ dose_group (and prespecified covariates if applicable)
If exposure is right-skewed, log-transformation may be used; results may be reported as geometric mean ratios.

Dose Proportionality (Key Secondary)
Dose proportionality will be assessed using a log–log regression model:
Model: log(exposure) = α + β * log(dose) + ε
Interpretation: β ≈ 1 suggests approximate proportionality across the tested dose range.
Results will be reported as β with standard error, confidence interval, and p-value.

Exposure–Response (Key Secondary)
The exposure–response relationship will be assessed using regression models with exposure as a continuous predictor:
If response is continuous: response ~ exposure (+ covariates as prespecified)
If response is binary: logit(P(response)) ~ exposure (+ covariates as prespecified)
Exposure metrics may include AUC and/or Cmax. The primary exposure metric used for modeling will be prespecified in the TFL shells; alternative metrics may be explored descriptively.

### Safety Summaries by Dose
Safety endpoints (DLT and/or TEAEs) will be summarized by dose group using counts and percentages. Where appropriate, dose group comparisons will be presented using risk differences and/or odds ratios with confidence intervals.

### Sensitivity Analyses
To assess robustness of the primary and key secondary estimands, the following sensitivity analyses will be conducted:
Transformation / distributional sensitivity
Evaluate model fit with exposure modeled on the original and log scale. Summaries may include geometric means when log-normality is plausible.

### Influential observations
Examine exposure outliers and influential points in dose proportionality and exposure–response models (e.g., leverage/Cook’s distance). Refit models excluding influential observations as a sensitivity check.

Alternative exposure metric
Repeat exposure–response analysis using an alternative exposure metric (e.g., Cmax instead of AUC) when both are available, to assess consistency of inference.

### Missing data sensitivity (exploratory)
Summarize missing PK parameters and missing response by dose group. Conduct simple exploratory sensitivity analyses (e.g., best/worst case for binary response, or baseline carry-forward for continuous response) to assess robustness to departures from MAR.

## Software
All analyses will be conducted in R using version-controlled, reproducible scripts and renv for dependency management. Quarto will be used for report generation and TFL development.
