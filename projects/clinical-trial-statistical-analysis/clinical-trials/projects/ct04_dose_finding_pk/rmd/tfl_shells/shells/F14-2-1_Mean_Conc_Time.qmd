## Population
PK population: all subjects with observed concentration–time data sufficient for plotting mean profiles.

## Output Shell

**Figure placeholder:** Mean concentration–time profiles by dose group.

- X-axis: Time (hours post-dose)
- Y-axis: Mean concentration (units)
- Separate lines for Placebo, Low, Medium, High
- Optional: error bands (SE or 95% CI) at nominal timepoints

## Notes / Footnotes
- Mean concentration computed at each nominal timepoint within dose group.
- Concentrations below LLOQ handling (if applicable) should be prespecified.
- Plot should indicate whether values are arithmetic mean or geometric mean.
