## Population
PK population: all subjects with observed concentration–time data.

## Output Shell

**Figure placeholder:** Individual (spaghetti) concentration–time profiles by dose group.

- Facet panels: Placebo, Low, Medium, High
- One line per subject
- Optional: overlay mean profile per panel

## Notes / Footnotes
- Spaghetti plot displays subject-level concentration–time curves.
- Y-axis scaling may be linear or log-scale; choice should be consistent with SAP.
- Consider transparency (alpha) to reduce overplotting in larger N.
