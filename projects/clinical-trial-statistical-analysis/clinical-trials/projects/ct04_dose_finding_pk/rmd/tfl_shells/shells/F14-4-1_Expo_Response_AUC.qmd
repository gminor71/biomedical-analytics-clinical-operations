## Population
PK population with derived AUC and non-missing binary response outcome.

## Output Shell

**Figure placeholder:** Exposure–response relationship using AUC (primary exposure).

- Scatter/jitter of observed binary responses vs AUC
- Overlay fitted logistic regression curve
- Optional: 95% confidence band for predicted probability

## Notes / Footnotes
- AUC is the primary exposure metric for exposure–response evaluation.
- Binary responses may be jittered vertically for visualization only.
- If exposure is transformed/scaled in the model, the plot should reflect that scale.
