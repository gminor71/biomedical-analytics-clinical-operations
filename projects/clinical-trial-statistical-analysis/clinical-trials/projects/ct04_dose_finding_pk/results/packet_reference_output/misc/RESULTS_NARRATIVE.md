# CT04 - Dose Finding and Pharmacokinetics Results Narrative

Generated: 2026-02-23 15:48:25

## Executive Summary
- Dose proportionality (primary exposure AUC): Dose proportionality (AUC): β=1.016 (95% CI [0.969, 1.064]); p=<0.001.
- Exposure–response (primary exposure AUC): Exposure–response (AUC): OR=1.00 (95% CI 0.85–1.16); p=0.973.
- Safety was summarized descriptively by dose group (AE and DLT).

## Study Overview
This early-phase dose-finding analysis evaluates pharmacokinetic exposure across dose levels and examines dose proportionality, exposure–response patterns, and safety by dose group.

## Dose Groups
Dose groups: Placebo (0 mg), Low (5 mg), Medium (10 mg), High (20 mg).

## Analysis Set and Data Overview
Subjects by dose group: Placebo=246, Low=85, Medium=89, High=80.

## PK Exposure (AUC)
Mean AUC by dose group: Placebo=0.0, Low=0.9, Medium=1.7, High=3.6.

## Primary Results
Dose proportionality (AUC): β=1.016 (95% CI [0.969, 1.064]); p=<0.001.

## Secondary Results
Exposure–response (AUC): OR=1.00 (95% CI 0.85–1.16); p=0.973.

## Safety
AE rates by dose group: Placebo=24.8%, Low=34.1%, Medium=27.0%, High=27.5%.
DLT rates by dose group: Placebo=0.4%, Low=1.2%, Medium=1.1%, High=1.2%.

## Conclusion
These outputs provide an end-to-end demonstration of early-phase PK analysis and decision-support summaries using reproducible code and frozen artifacts.
