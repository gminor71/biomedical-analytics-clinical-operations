CT04 Diagnostics Summary

Files generated in results/diagnostics/:
- Dose proportionality (AUC/Cmax): residual vs fitted, QQ plot, Cook's distance
- Exposure-response (AUC/Cmax): binned calibration, Cook's distance, predicted probability vs exposure

Top influential observations exported as CSV:
- TopInfluence_DoseProp_AUC.csv
- TopInfluence_DoseProp_Cmax.csv
- TopInfluence_ExposureResponse_AUC.csv
- TopInfluence_ExposureResponse_Cmax.csv

Interpretation note:
These diagnostics are intended to flag influential subjects and model-fit issues for follow-up.
They do not automatically imply exclusion; sensitivity refits may be performed if warranted.
