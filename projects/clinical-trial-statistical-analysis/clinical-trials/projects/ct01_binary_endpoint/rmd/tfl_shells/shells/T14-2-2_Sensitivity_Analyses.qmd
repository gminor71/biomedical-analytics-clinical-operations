Purpose

Provide supportive analyses to assess robustness of the primary conclusion and explore potential effect modification.

Population

Intention-to-treat (ITT): all randomized subjects analyzed by assigned treatment.

Notes / Footnotes

Sensitivity model: logistic regression adjusting for treatment, age, sex.

Exploratory interaction model adds baseline severity and treatment × baseline severity interaction.

“OR at representative severities” may be computed using the fitted interaction model (e.g., delta method).

Exploratory analyses are hypothesis-generating and interpreted cautiously.

* The interaction term is typically interpreted as the multiplicative change in the treatment OR per 1-unit increase in baseline severity.
