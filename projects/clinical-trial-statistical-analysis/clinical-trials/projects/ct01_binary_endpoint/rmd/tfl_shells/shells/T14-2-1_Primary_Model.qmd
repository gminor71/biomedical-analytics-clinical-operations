Objective

Evaluate whether Active treatment reduces the odds of the binary clinical event by Day 365 compared with Control.

Population

Intention-to-treat (ITT): all randomized subjects analyzed by assigned treatment.

Endpoint

Binary indicator of event occurrence by Day 365 (event_bin; 1=event, 0=no event).

Model

Logistic regression with fixed effects for treatment group and prespecified covariates.

Output Shell (Adjusted Treatment Effect)
Comparison	Effect Measure	Estimate	95% CI	p-value
Active vs Control	Odds Ratio	x.xx	(x.xx, x.xx)	x.xxx
Model Covariates (Prespecified)

Age

Baseline severity

Notes / Footnotes

Treatment effect reported as adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval from the fitted model.

Reference group: Control.

Analysis uses complete cases for prespecified covariates unless otherwise specified in the SAP.
