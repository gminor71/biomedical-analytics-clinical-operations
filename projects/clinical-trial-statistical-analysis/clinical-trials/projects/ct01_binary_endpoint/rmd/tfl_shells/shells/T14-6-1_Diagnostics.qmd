Purpose

Summarize diagnostic checks for the prespecified primary logistic regression model.

Population

Primary analysis dataset (typically complete-case for prespecified covariates).

Output Shell
(A) Collinearity Assessment (VIF / GVIF)
Term	VIF (or GVIF^(1/(2*Df)))	Flag (Y/N)
Treatment	x.xx	N
Age	x.xx	N
Sex	x.xx	N
Baseline severity	x.xx	N
(B) Influence Assessment (Cook’s Distance / Leverage)
Summary Item	Result
High Cook’s D count (rule-of-thumb)	xx
High leverage count (rule-of-thumb)	xx
Top influential subjects reviewed	Yes/No
(C) Diagnostic Figures

Deviance residuals vs fitted probability

Q–Q plot of standardized deviance residuals

Cook’s distance plot

Leverage plot

Notes / Footnotes

VIF interpretation: rule-of-thumb concern often > 5–10 (context dependent).

Influence thresholds are heuristic and used for review, not automatic exclusion.

Diagnostics are used to support model adequacy; no data points are excluded unless prespecified.
