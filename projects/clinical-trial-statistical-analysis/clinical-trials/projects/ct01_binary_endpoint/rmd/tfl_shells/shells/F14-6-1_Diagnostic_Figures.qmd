Purpose

Provide standard diagnostic figures supporting the adequacy of the prespecified primary logistic regression model.

Population

Primary analysis dataset (typically complete-case for prespecified covariates).

Output Shell

The following diagnostic figures are presented:

Deviance residuals vs fitted probability

Q–Q plot of standardized deviance residuals

Cook’s distance

Leverage (hat values)

Notes / Footnotes

Diagnostic figures are reviewed to identify potential model fit issues, influential observations, and departures from assumptions.

Thresholds for influence (e.g., Cook’s D, leverage) are heuristic and used for review; observations are not excluded unless prespecified.
