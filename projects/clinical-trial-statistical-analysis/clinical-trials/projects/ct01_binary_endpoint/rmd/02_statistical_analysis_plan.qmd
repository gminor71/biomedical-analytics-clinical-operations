## Objectives
Evaluate whether Active treatment reduces the odds of the binary clinical event by Day 365 compared with Control.

## Analysis Population
Primary analysis will be conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized subjects analyzed by assigned treatment).

## Primary Endpoint
Binary indicator of event occurrence by Day 365 (`event_bin`; 1=event, 0=no event).

## Primary Statistical Methods
A logistic regression model will be fit with treatment group as the primary predictor, adjusting for age, sex, and baseline severity. Results will be reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

## Secondary / Sensitivity Analyses
- Alternative covariate specifications (e.g., with and without baseline severity).
- Exploratory treatment-by-baseline severity interaction to assess effect modification.

## 6. Software
All analyses will be conducted in R using validated scripts.
