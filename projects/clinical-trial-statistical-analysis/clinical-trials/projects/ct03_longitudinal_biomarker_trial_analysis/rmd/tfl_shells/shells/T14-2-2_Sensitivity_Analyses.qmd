## Population
Intention-to-treat (ITT): all randomized subjects analyzed by assigned treatment.

## Purpose
This table summarizes sensitivity analyses performed to evaluate robustness of the primary efficacy results.

## Output Shell

| Analysis | Model / Method | Effect Estimate | 95% CI | p-value | Interpretation |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Primary analysis | [Primary model description] | xx.xx | xx.xx – xx.xx | 0.xxx | Reference |
| Sensitivity 1 | Alternative covariate adjustment | xx.xx | xx.xx – xx.xx | 0.xxx | Consistent / Not consistent |
| Sensitivity 2 | Alternative time specification / model form | xx.xx | xx.xx – xx.xx | 0.xxx | Consistent / Not consistent |
| Sensitivity 3 | Missing data approach | xx.xx | xx.xx – xx.xx | 0.xxx | Consistent / Not consistent |

## Notes / Footnotes
- Sensitivity analyses are prespecified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
- Effect estimates correspond to:
  - Odds Ratio (CT01)
  - Hazard Ratio (CT02)
  - Treatment-by-time coefficient (CT03)
- Analyses are exploratory and intended to assess robustness rather than multiplicity-controlled inference.
