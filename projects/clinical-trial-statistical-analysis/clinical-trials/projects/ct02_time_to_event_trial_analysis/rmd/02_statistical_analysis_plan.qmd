## Objectives
Evaluate the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes within a randomized clinical trial setting.

## Analysis Population
Primary analysis will be conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized subjects analyzed according to assigned treatment group.

## Primary Endpoint
Time from randomization to first occurrence of the clinical event, measured in days (time).
Subjects without an event will be censored at last known follow-up (status; 1=event, 0=censored).

## Primary Statistical Methods
The primary analysis will use a Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment group as the primary predictor, adjusting for age, sex, and baseline severity.
Results will be reported as adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals and Wald p-values.
The Control group will serve as the reference category.

## Model Assumptions and Diagnostics
The proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals.
Kaplan–Meier survival curves will be generated by treatment group for descriptive and diagnostic purposes.
Influential observations will be assessed using dfbeta diagnostics.

## Secondary / Sensitivity Analyses
- Sensitivity analysis excluding baseline severity from the adjustment set.
- Exploratory treatment-by-baseline severity interaction model to assess effect modification.
- Hazard ratios will be estimated at representative baseline severity values (e.g., 40, 50, 60).

## Missing Data Handling
The primary analysis will use complete-case data for covariates included in the model.
Censoring will be assumed to be non-informative.

## Software
All analyses will be conducted in R using validated scripts.
