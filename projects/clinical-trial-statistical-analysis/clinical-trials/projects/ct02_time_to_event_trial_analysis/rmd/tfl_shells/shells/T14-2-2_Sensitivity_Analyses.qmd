## Notes / Footnotes
- Hazard ratios derived from Cox proportional hazards model.
- Hazard ratio <1 favors Active treatment.
- Model adjusted for prespecified baseline covariates.

## Analyses
Sensitivity and exploratory analyses supporting the primary Cox model.

### Sensitivity Analysis (Adjusted for Age and Sex Only)

| Variable | Hazard Ratio | 95% CI | p-value |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Treatment (Active vs Control) | x.xx | (x.xx, x.xx) | 0.xxx |

### Exploratory Interaction Model

| Variable | Hazard Ratio | 95% CI | p-value |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Treatment (Active vs Control) | x.xx | (x.xx, x.xx) | 0.xxx |
| Treatment × Baseline Severity | x.xx | (x.xx, x.xx) | 0.xxx |

## Notes / Footnotes
- Sensitivity analyses assess robustness of the primary estimand.
- Interaction analyses are exploratory and not confirmatory.
