## Objective
Evaluate whether Active treatment changes the longitudinal trajectory of the biomarker over 365 days compared with Control.

## Estimand (Primary)
Difference in biomarker trajectory over time between Active vs Control, quantified by the **treatment-by-time interaction**.

## Model
Linear mixed-effects model with:
- Fixed effects: treatment, time (continuous), treatment × time, age, sex, baseline severity, BMI
- Random effects: subject-level random intercept
- Estimation: maximum likelihood under MAR

## Output Shell

| Effect / Term | Estimate (SE) | 95% CI | p-value |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Treatment × Time (primary estimand)** | β = x.xxxx (x.xxxx) | (x.xxxx, x.xxxx) | p=0.xxx |
| Treatment (Active vs Control) | β = x.xxxx (x.xxxx) | (x.xxxx, x.xxxx) | p=0.xxx |
| Time (per unit) | β = x.xxxx (x.xxxx) | (x.xxxx, x.xxxx) | p=0.xxx |
| Age | β = x.xxxx (x.xxxx) | (x.xxxx, x.xxxx) | p=0.xxx |
| Sex (M vs F) | β = x.xxxx (x.xxxx) | (x.xxxx, x.xxxx) | p=0.xxx |
| Baseline severity | β = x.xxxx (x.xxxx) | (x.xxxx, x.xxxx) | p=0.xxx |
| BMI | β = x.xxxx (x.xxxx) | (x.xxxx, x.xxxx) | p=0.xxx |

## Notes / Footnotes
- Primary interpretation focuses on **Treatment × Time**.
- Time scaling must be stated (e.g., per 30 days if modeled as time30).
- Model uses all available repeated measures under a Missing At Random (MAR) assumption.
